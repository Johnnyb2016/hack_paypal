# Introduction #

PayPal business accounts allow sub-users, who have specific
permissions. This is wonderful in that it allows people to not share
passwords. Unfortunately, PayPal does not provide any tools to manage
these.

As I happen to have many different business accounts, and need to
manage many users across them, I thought I'd write some scripts.

This is much less of a *software* project, and much more of a *quick
hack*. You've been warned.

# Future Work #

Almost too much to list, but here are some areas that really need work

* Errors and feedback.
* Assigning `priv_permission_contact`, possible with selenium
